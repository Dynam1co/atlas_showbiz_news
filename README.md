# Atlas - Showbiz News

With this project I intend to cover various topics and use different current tools.

## Starting 🚀

The basic idea is to get third-party data using Python and Kafka, process that data, store it in DDBB using microservices, and publish Tweets by reading that data. Everything automatically.

## Used Tools 🛠️
- Docker: for manage Kafka consumers and producers.
- Neovim: as IDE for Python
- Postgre: to store data
- AWS (Rds): to host the database

## Libraries

- kafka-python: Python client for the Apache Kafka [Git Hub](https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python).
- FastAPI: Web framework for builgin APIs with Python [Web](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Alembic: Manage database migrations. [Documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
- uuid: Generate unique ids. [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)
- tweepy: Twitter API communication. [Web](https://www.tweepy.org/)
